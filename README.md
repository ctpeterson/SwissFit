SwissFit is a general-purpose library for fitting models to data with Gaussian-distributed noise. The design of this library is inspired by Peter Lepage's [lsqfit](https://github.com/gplepage/lsqfit). As such, it builds on top of the [GVar](https://github.com/gplepage/gvar) library and extensively utilizes the powerful numerical tools of [SciPy](https://scipy.org/) and [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/). SwissFit is readily deployable; however, it is under active development. I hope come out with a fully-tested/stable release of SwissFit sometime in the first two quarters of 2024.
